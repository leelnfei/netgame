The above. Basically a fork from a dead project by Glenn Fiedler at http://gafferongames.com/. 
He posted on his site that he no longer has time to monitor and work with the code. He also posted that 
his code is Public Domain. I intend to keep this code updated as best I can. It's very useful for games and such.
